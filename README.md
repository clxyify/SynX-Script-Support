# SynX-Script-Support

Some scripts check for synapse x support, but this problem is now solved.

# Script Functions Supported
`syn`
`synapsex`
`PROTOSMASHER_LOADED`
`is_synapse_function`

You can check the function by running a synapse X script!

# Side Announcement

Please use **SynX2** as it's better at non-detections.

If you want to see better explanation on it:

You see it returns 'asd' otherwise if it doesn't, it will crash synapse X.
